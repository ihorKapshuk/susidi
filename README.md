Application for residents of an apartment building, which can increase the efficiency of interaction between residents and building administration.

My application must solve problems which appear during usage of traditional messengers:
1.Absence of categories (messages of all types usually are sent to common chat - this can decrease speed of reaction from administration to residents requests)
2.Absence of separation to posts and comments sections:
a.Comments compete for attention of users with posts
b.Unnecessary personal conversation between users appears in the chat

Project requirements:
Python 3.11+;
Django 5.0.1;
Bootstrap 5;
Django-crispy-forms;
Pillow;
PostgreSQL 16.1.
